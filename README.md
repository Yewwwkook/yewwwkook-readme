#  Yewwwkook

![yewwwkook logo](./assets/yewwwkookLogo.png)

**Yewwwkook** is an app that delivers real-time surf reports â€” straight from the beach.  
No stale forecasts. No broken surf cams. Just raw, honest updates from fellow wave chasers.

---

##  Why It Exists

- Traditional surf forecasting tools are expensive or unreliable
- Surfers waste time and gas chasing poor conditions
- Cams and NOAA data are increasingly limited or broken
- The community deserves a **free, fast, and trustworthy** alternative

---

##  What It Does

Yewwwkook is a crowd-powered platform that enables surfers to share and access real-time surf conditions across their favorite breaks.

It works by rewarding verified contributors and unlocking useful insights in return,  creating a tight feedback loop driven by the surf community itself.

More details coming soon as we open our first round of live testing.

A give-to-get system that keeps the stoke alive â€” and the info fresh.
